Hi there! 👋 I'm Momen Ashraf  
🚀 AI Engineer | LLM Systems • RAG • Agentic Workflows • Production MLOps

I’m an **AI Engineer** focused on building **production-grade LLM-powered systems** used by real users at scale.  
I specialize in **agentic architectures**, **multi-agent orchestration**, **RAG pipelines**, and **tool-integrated AI assistants**, with strong experience deploying reliable AI services across **Azure and on-prem infrastructure**.

---

## 🔥 What I Build
### 🤖 LLM-Powered Products (Production)
- **Enterprise AI Assistants & Chatbots** for customer support and internal workflows
- **Automated ticket summarization** & knowledge retrieval systems
- **Tool-using agents** with memory, planning, and multi-step execution
- **Safety-aware systems**: hallucination mitigation, fallback logic, confidence thresholds

### 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- End-to-end **RAG pipelines** using **LLaMA**
- Vector search & hybrid retrieval using:
  - **Qdrant**, **Milvus**, **pgvector**
- Prompt + retrieval optimization for latency, quality, and cost

### 🧩 Agentic Systems & Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Multi-agent collaboration & delegation patterns
- Agent memory management + context engineering
- Evaluation pipelines for continuous improvement
- Frameworks:
  - **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**
  - OpenAI Agents SDK (tool orchestration)
